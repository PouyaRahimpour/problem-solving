## CP problem-solving
This is a repository where I'll push my solutions to the cp and algorithmic problems I solve in some platforms.
feel free to search for a problem statement. they're mostely in camel-case like exampleFile.cpp.

Problems in cf (codeforces) directory are organized based on rating and contests that I've given
